# Frequent Pattern Mining with Eclat

My implementation of the (simple, i.e., not optimized) eclat algorithm for frequent item set mining. 

Parts of this code were originally created in an extracurricular project while visiting the course "Frequent Pattern Mining" by Prof. Borgelt as part of my data science study.
I revised and commented my original code and finally uploaded it to git.


For more effieciently implemented pattern mining algorithms I can only recommend visiting https://borgelt.net/.
